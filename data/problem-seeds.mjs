* Write a function that takes in one number as input
  * This input will be how many levels of stairs the output should have.
* It will then \`\`\`console.log\`\`\` stairs that match the following look:

  \`\`\`console

  * When input is 5:

  \`\`\``,
  hint: `# Hints
* Use a for loop
* Use a variable to store and build your output
* Try and figure out a pattern to build one line from the previous line
* Use that pattern in the for loop
* Remember you can only use console.log so you must print out an entire line for each console.log
* You could use an array to hold the stairs data and then use array methods to add and remove from the front and end of the array if needed.`,
